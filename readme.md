# 🦸‍♂️ Cypress Heroes - E2E Test Automation Project

A fully automated end-to-end testing project built with **Cypress**, focused on dynamic validations, conditional tests, and real-world user simulation for the **cy.heroes** application.

---

## 🧪 About the Project

This project simulates real interactions in a hero management app where users can **create, edit, delete, and interact with heroes**, applying solid E2E testing practices.

Covered flows include:
- Login and authentication
- Hero creation and editing
- Action buttons (like, hire, edit, delete)
- Field validation with valid and invalid inputs
- Conditional modal messages based on login state
- Dynamic data generation and randomization

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) — Main E2E test framework
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [Chance.js](https://chancejs.com/) — Random data generation
- [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) — For test planning and documentation

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Practice real-world test automation with broad feature coverage
- Apply conditional validation logic (e.g., modal behavior changes with login state)
- Use dynamic/random data for realistic testing
- Showcase clear structure, technical know-how, and testing principles
- Present a portfolio-ready QA project to recruiters and tech teams

## 🧠 Key Features Tested

| Test Area       | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| 🔐 Login        | Valid login using fixture data |
| 🧾 Create Hero  | Fill out form using generated data |
| ✏️ Edit Hero    | Clear and update input values |
| 🗑️ Delete Hero  | Delete and confirm redirection to home |
| 🏠 Home Actions | Like and hire buttons with dynamic target selection |
| 📋 Conditional Tests | Modals behave differently for logged-in vs. guest users |
